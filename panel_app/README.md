# _Bank Stocks Portfolio Algorithm_

  In our second project we used a selection of bank stock data we gathered to determine potential gains throughout ones' portfolio. In order to do this we have used a ML(machine learning) algorithm to drop a portfolio inside of our questionnaire and it will return potential gains/loses.

## Technologies

  - Operating Systems: Mac OS, Windows
  - Programming Language: Python
  - Libraries: Pandas,Numpy,Hvplot,Matplotlib,Warnings,Watermark,Panel,Standard Scaler
  - Frameworks: JupyterLab

-----------------

## Installation 

  In order to properly use our code there is a couple of things that need to initally be installed which include.

  - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3717/)
  - [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)

  After all of the things above have been installed you can then proceed with cloning the code(to either a pre-created folder or a new folder).The cloning of said code can be seen below.

  Once the code has been copied and your pre-requisites have been installed then you need to download your module to properly run code. Found below you can see a list of modules and under the list you can see how to install each  module.
