Analysis data by clusters for first unsupervised learning model
i.e., look at cluster 7 and a cluster that follows set time.
Isolate dataframe by those two clusters and then look at x y variables that are not time to find why cluster 7 was made.

Use stock price as target for supervised learning so that rather than buying or selling stock outright, it is trying to predict stock prices given the variables.
Use one model for indvidual bank stock with other bank stock included,
Use other model without bank stock included.
This will be more of an "advisory" model rather than a trading algo.
Use neural network

Have user upload industry stock or mixed and choose which option they did.
If industry portfolio will use included model
If not will use indivdual model

Have an "insight" page for website/app. Will just go through what I have done so far in terms of exploring data and just showcasing interesting things gleaned from analysis like 
citibank and jp morgan prices having negative correlation.

day with crisis or day without crisis try to find this out.
