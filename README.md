# _Bank Stocks Portfolio Algorithm_

  In our second project we developed a bank stock advisor. Our code runs a ML model to predict bank stock prices which then allows us to give/receive advice based on a persons' portfolio. 
  
-----------------

## Technologies

  - Operating Systems: Mac OS, Windows
  - Programming Language: Python
  - Libraries: Pandas,Numpy,Hvplot,Matplotlib,Warnings,Watermark,Panel,Standard Scaler,Streamlit
  - Frameworks: JupyterLab,HTML

-----------------

## Installation 

  In order to properly use our code there is a couple of things that need to initally be installed which include.

  - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3717/)
  - [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install)

  After all of the things above have been installed you can then proceed with cloning the code(to either a pre-created folder or a new folder).  
  1. Go the the github repository and locate the green code button  
  2. Click on the code button and then copy the HTTPS link provided  
  3. Open a terminal and navigate to where you would like the code to be i.e. ```cd .\project2\.```  
  4. Run the ```git clone https://github.com/greg-krulin/Project-2-.git``` command

  Once the code has been copied and your pre-requisites have been installed then you need to download your module to properly run code. Found below you can see a list of modules and under the list you can see how to install each  module.

  List of modules: [Modules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11d9BxMvM-SLomjxevWBR8p6_0VbAzo7C8bBW8Xx0KlY/edit?usp=sharing)

-1. Activate a conda dev environment within your terminal

    conda activate dev

-2. Install the modules within your terminal

    pip install -r requirements.txt

------------------------

## Usage and Application

  1. Launch Streamlit  (make sure your web browser is not in dark mode)  
  -Open up a terminal on your desktop  
  -Navigate into the folder in which you cloned the repository  
  -Search for the ml_app.py file and when located use the ```streamlit run ml_app.py``` command

  2. Explore features within the streamlit  
  -Change your selections within the stock graphs, correlation, multi-correlation and machine learning results tabs to recieve different results

  3. Chat with the bot and receive bank stock data/advice  
  -Locate the miniatrue purple message bubble and begin asking/answering questions
